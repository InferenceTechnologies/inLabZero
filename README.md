inLabZero package
===================

The R package for the inLab platform, for more information please visit [www.inferencetech.com](www.inferencetech.com)

Data
----

inLab allows to integrate any kind of data into the single platform and to add, merge and combine data easily within the existing framework. Most importantly, the inLab approach means to curate data at the beginning considering analysis requirements at the end.

Analytical edge
---------------

inLab creates analytical edge through a well-thought-out combination of machine learning tools with customer's domain expertise. In a multi-dimensional manufacturing space with thousands of parameters, this approach makes it possible to identify a yield impacting issue with an unprecedented precision and speed.

Defectivity insight
-------------------

inLab allows to link defect inspection maps to probe maps so that probe maps can be used as the response for the die and defect level analysis. At the die level, inLab Bayesian tools can be employed to evaluate detected defects potency and estimate yield loss explained. At the defect level sensitive die areas can be identified using inLab die defect impact heatmaps.
